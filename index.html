               i Started Android Development 4 Years Ago <br />
                When i Designed My First Android Costume ROM <br />
                it Wasn't That Easy To Redesign it For The First Time<br />
                *************************************************<br />

             My First Project:<br />
                So The First Thing i've Done With Android Was a Redesign for The HTC Sans ROM<br />
                Not That Easy Cause HTC Roms Are So Secured <br />
                After Finding a Non-Secured Version From This ROM i Managed To Do it<br />
                Unfortunetly i couldn't Upload it to The Web<br />
                ************************************************<br />
                
                My Second Project:<br />
                Making a Pre-Rooted Original ROM For Xperia Z1 C6903 <br />
                i Broke My boot.img 2 Times Because Of this ROM <br/>
                After 2 Days Of Trying i Made it Perfectly And It's Still Running On My Phone!<br />
                *************************************************<br />
                
                My 3rd And Last Project:
                it was The ROAD Project <br />
                The Word ROAD Means: Reactive Old Android Devices<br />
                But Because Of the Bachelloria (Last Year Of High School) i Didn't Manage To Continue This Project<br />
                as Well as Being Attacked By Other Devs in this Community<br />
                ANDROID COMMUNITY IS THE WORST!!!<br />
                Every One Want To Steal Your Work And Make You an Unsuccessful Developer!<br/>
                That's Why i decided To Leave it...

            i'm Not an iOS Developer..<br />
                i Like To Be but i can't Cause I Don't Have a Mac<br />
                After Leaving The Android Community i Wanted To Join The Apple Community<br />
                i've entered Twitter (Which is One Of The Less-Used Websites in My Country)<br />
                And Found Out This Beautiful Community <br />
                Where People And Developers Work Togeather To Reach Their Goal,<br />
                Which is Jailbreak!<br />

                ***<br />
                i Joined JailbreakRescue in Dec 2016<br />
                it Was a Great Team But we Didn't Manage To Work Because There Was a Huge Number Of Members!<br />
                After 5 Months Of Working...Nothing Happened, We Failed And The Team Died!<br />
                i Decided To Make a New Team <br />
                a Similar One But it's Going to Support Jailbroken & Non-Jailbroken iDevices<br />
                it's JB2iOS Team!
                We Help People By Answering Al Their Questions<br />
                After That We Upload a Tutorial To Our Youtube Channel To Make Sure That Everyone Can Solve This Problem Without Asking Us Again.<br />
